This repo consists of the html files used for our github webpage made in the course 02806 Social Data Analysis and Visualization on DTU in the spring 2020.

The data folder contains html files used in iframes.

Furthermore two other reps (bokeh and bokeh2) exists; each is used to serve a bokeh application. Both these applications are shown on the "Find School" tab.
