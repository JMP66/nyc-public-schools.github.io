Students thrive in a nurturing setting where they build a strong personal connection that facilitates student achievement while meeting their emotional and social needs. The cornerstones of this atmosphere are rooted in developing: a community of learners where students, parents, and staff seek to expand their knowledge; building leadership capacity where all constituencies develop ownership of the school's mission, vision, and educational process; a collegial environment that emphasizes the learning process through sharing of knowledge, strategies, and methodologies; a school of philosophers where pertinent questions are asked ensuring vitality and growth. Our academic environment is one of great rigor, offering a range of honors courses in grades seven and eight, and a variety of special programs including Chess Club, CHAMPS, Real Heroes program, Youth Alive, Legion of Leaders, Debate Team, Tri-M, Drama Club Grades 6-8, Extravaganza Grades K-5, and Festival Choir Grades 5-8.","74-10 Commonwealth Boulevard, Queens NY 11426",sites.google.com/psis266.org/k-8,8am-2:20pm,True,True,True,True,"Band, Chorus, Music, Technology, Visual Arts","Career Day, Chess Club, Debate Team, Drama Club, Festival Choir, High School Teaching Interns, IntenSati, Mighty Milers Running Club, Multicultural Day, Real Heroes, Wellness Council","Cross Country, Flag Football, Volleyball",11426.0,40.746231,-73.727614,14.2,73.36210000000001,11,5,3,7.199999999999999,18.967112717276432,1.0,21.185,2.0
