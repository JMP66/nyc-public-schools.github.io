P.S. 34 Franklin Delano Roosevelt Middle School experience provides students the opportunities to develop as independent, critical thinkers immersed in rigorous instruction to promote college- and career-readiness skills. As we focus on teaching the whole child in a safe, nurturing environment we encourage positive social emotional growth and provide community service opportunities to enhance our students' academic growth. Our school setting enables us to address students individual academic, social, and behavioral needs. We take students on field trips to universities, such as Harvard and Yale. As an adopted school by the District Attorney's office, our students take trips to the courthouse and law firms. Some special programs we offer include: mock trial, peer mediation, student council, Book Club, basketball, volleyball, and flag football. We recognize student achievement monthly during assemblies for perfect attendance, Scholar of the Month, and Honor Roll. Honor students are rewarded with trips to go bowling and ice skating. Parents appreciate our supportive learning environment where teachers know the students well and expect the best from each student.\",\"We are a community of learners focused on success. We encourage our students to take risks, to try their best, and to take advantage of the opportunities offered at our school. We take pride in the small school community. The students say: \\\"The teachers are very understanding and supportive. They care about us and point us in the right direction.\\\" In order to meet the Common Core Standards, the curricula used are Scholastic Code-X for ELA and Pearson CMP3 for Math. In social studies and science courses, we focus on project-based learning. We have a technology lab, science lab, and a fully equipped gymnasium. Our students have a variety of leadership opportunities through student council, safety patrol, and book buddies with the lower grades. In addition, our students receive small group support and/or elective on alternating days. Our students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of after-school programs funded by the 21st Century and community-based organizations.\",\"We are developing a culture of college-minded students and working with community members to create a challenging learning environment. Parents appreciate our family-like atmosphere and the bilingual, bi-cultural learning opportunity. In school year 2018-2019, dual-language program courses will extend to both sixth and seventh grade which will continue to grow one grade at a time each year. In the Dual Language Program, there will be a beginning level dual-language program for students who are less proficient in Mandarin Chinese, and an advanced level dual-language program for students who are more advanced in Mandarin Chinese.
